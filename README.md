**RecFlix**

RecFlix is a java application that serves to provide Netflix media recommendations based off the user's preferences. 
The user's preferences are broken down into 2 choices:
1. Choice 1: The user will decide if they are interested in TV shows, movies, or both
2. Choice 2: The user will then choose to provide one of the following: person, genre, or year

Based on the user's choices, the top 10 results will be presented, ranked in descending order based off the respective IMDB rankings.

If the results are unsatifactory to the user, they will have the option to present the next 10 media titles.

**Disclaimer**
The functionality of this application relies heavily on the authenticity of the RapidAPI Netflix database. 
There is no gaurnatee the API request will return accurate results as I do not have direct control over the Netflix database.
